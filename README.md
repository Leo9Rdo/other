sheep.exe - is a fun little program that decorates your desktop. It was written in C++. Once launched, a shimmering sheep starts flying across the screen and randomly attaches to the cursor, blocking any clicks. You can launch sheep.exe multiple times to create your own flock of sheep on the screen. 
КОТ.exe - modifies the cursor, turning it into a cat. This program was also written in C++.
